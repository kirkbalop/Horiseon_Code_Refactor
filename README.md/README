      Refactor existing code to optimize both accessibility and search engine performance, while also clearing up any redundancies or syntactical errors
      found. Ensure the code is properly annotated and overall clean and concise.

      Upon testing the code in browser I determined that a few links were not working as intended, so I set about checking the "id" and "class" selectors to ensure
      that they matched and were syntactically correct. In doing so I also took the time to provide alt labels to all images in the HTML. I then checked the stylesheet and noticed a number of redundancies that were then consolidated, removing
      several unnecessary lines of code. The pathways were all cross-checked and the CSS was reordered so that the order represented that of the HTML file.
